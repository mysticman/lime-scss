**The most important principles of this framework**

#### Flexbox grid system
- A modern grid system should be based on flexbox
- Much more flexible than bootstrap (not only n/12 col width)
- Pull, push capability
- Horizontal and vertical alignment opstions via flexbox (around, between etc.)
- More and customizable media breakpoint

#### Lightweight
   - The core framework should only contains the fully customizable grid layout
   - Not contain a UI element what has got Javascript dependency
   - A framework should contains only the most frequently used elements (typography, form, buttons, image, table, callout)

### Modular and flexible
   - For the framework you could add more UI elements easily what without change the core
   - All of the core components should be overrideable with easily
   - Separate the scss architecture because of readability

#### Built in support for mobiles and tablets
  - Most of the css frameworks has got lack of support for specific mobile and tablet devices because of pixel density

#### Philisophy 
   - Based on the SMACSS principles
   - The class naming convetion is very important in a framework, it should be clear, tidy, meaningfull and familiar for everybody
